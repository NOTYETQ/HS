use enums or something to handle the roles, categories, and actions

Have all buttons that change the view of which screen and forms to show

also handle what it should do 

put 
/* if (bool function) {
  what will happen to the ui if  handled
}
what will happen to the ui if not handled*/

like hurricanes, bookings, locations, users, shelters
// have a function to refresh which table dependent on category
showtable{
  switch(category)
}
// do a function to set up which ui to show
setupUI{
  switch (role)
}

use 1 button 
changeworkerScreen() {
  switc(category)
}

// changes the form or calls delete dependent on category and action
actionfunction() {
  switch(category)
    case category
    switch(action)
    
}
// function to handle the confirms
// gathers the stuff from the text ui and calls the function for ow just have them in a qstringlist

confirm function() {
  switch(category)
    case category
    switch(action)
    
}

// function to hide everything
// do minor functions if they are repeated alot
// make thing you repeat more than once a function

// Put environmenet files when ready
