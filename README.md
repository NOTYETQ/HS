use enums or something to handle the roles, categories, and actions

Have all buttons that change the view of which screen and forms to show

also handle what it should do 

put 
/* if (bool function) {
  what will happen to the ui if  handled
}
what will happen to the ui if not handled*/

like hurricanes, bookings, locations, users, shelters
// have a function to refresh which table dependent on category
showtable{
  switch(category)
}
// do a function to set up which ui to show
setupUI{
  switch (role)
}

use 1 button 
changeworkerScreen() {
  switc(category)
}

// changes the form or calls delete dependent on category and action
actionfunction() {
  switch(category)
    case category
    switch(action)
    
}
// function to handle the confirms
// gathers the stuff from the text ui and calls the function for ow just have them in a qstringlist

confirm function() {
  switch(category)
    case category
    switch(action)
    
}

// function to hide everything
// do minor functions if they are repeated alot
// make thing you repeat more than once a function

// Put environmenet files when ready
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
DB_USER=
DB_PASS=
DB_DATABASE=


also handle the comboboxes i done send the code for this previously find it

remember shelters depends on locations and locations depends regions
disable shelters and locatiosn until region is selected for that set of comboboxes;


use the connect() function to connect signals 

try avoid using the default slots  or repeated values

add an environment variable or a member function named hurricane active and other true false to test where the functiosn will go


Make it so that the if a customer has a booking it wont show the makebooking button and if the customer does not have one it will show the booking button but not the cancel button

also add the files hurricaneflags to show that when a hurricane is active what flag it has

also in the frames hurricane details and booking details
show the details of the shelter with QLabels
also add images where deemed necessary
make the fricking ui look pretty
add translations to 3 languages
add menu items
add button to see users previous queries

if something needs a query tell me so i add it in the base classes
